# Dietify-Doc.

Objective
This report will explain the technologies, tools, and libraries that will be used to create the Dietify MVP. The aim is to provide you with a simple, easy-to-understand overview of what each tool does and why it's used for different parts of the application.

Overview of the MVP
The Dietify MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will allow users to:
Sign up and log in (Authentication).
Answer a questionnaire about their health and eating habits.
Receive a personalized diet plan based on their input.
Upload food images for nutritional analysis.
Download their diet plan in PDF or Excel format.

Key Components of the MVP
User Authentication
Questionnaire for Customization
AI for Personalized Diet Plan Generation
Food Image Analysis
Results Delivery (PDF/Excel Downloads)
Backend and Database Hosting
Payment Integration

1. User Authentication
Tool Used: Firebase Authentication (Free Tier)
What it does:
Firebase Authentication will be used to handle user sign-ups, logins, and account management. It supports logins using email or phone numbers, which makes it easier for users to get started.
Why we use it:
Firebase provides a secure and easy-to-integrate way to manage authentication. It’s reliable and integrates smoothly with other components of the application.

2. Questionnaire for Customization
Tool Used: ReactJS (Frontend) + Firebase Firestore (Backend)
What it does:
The questionnaire will be built using ReactJS, a modern JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It allows us to create dynamic, responsive forms.
Firebase Firestore will be used to store user responses and allow easy retrieval of data.
Why we use it:
ReactJS is lightweight and easy to work with, helping us create a smooth user experience. Firestore is a NoSQL database that's fast, scalable, and allows us to easily store and retrieve questionnaire data in real time.

3. AI for Personalized Diet Plan Generation
Tool Used: OpenAI GPT-3 (Free Tier or Custom Models)
What it does:
GPT-3 (the AI behind ChatGPT) will be used to process user inputs from the questionnaire and generate a personalized diet plan. It can take user information (like weight, height, and goals) and produce a meal plan with detailed nutritional recommendations.
Why we use it:
GPT-3 is a powerful and flexible language model that can generate high-quality text-based content. By using GPT-3, we can generate complex and tailored diet plans without needing to build an AI model from scratch, which saves time and effort.

4. Food Image Analysis
Tool Used: Clarifai (Free Tier)
What it does:
Clarifai is an AI-powered tool that can analyze food images uploaded by users. It will identify the food items in the image and provide nutritional information such as calories, macronutrients, and more.
Why we use it:
Clarifai provides a free API that works well for recognizing food in images. It's a reliable tool that helps us automatically analyze and calculate the nutritional content of the food, providing additional data to refine the user’s diet plan.

5. Results Delivery (PDF/Excel Downloads)
Tools Used: jsPDF (For PDF) + SheetJS (For Excel)
What they do:
jsPDF will be used to generate downloadable PDF documents with the user’s diet plan.
SheetJS will be used to create downloadable Excel spreadsheets.
Why we use them:
Both of these libraries are lightweight and easy to use for generating downloadable files. jsPDF and SheetJS are open-source and free, making them the perfect choice for creating PDF and Excel documents that users can download and save.

6. Backend and Database Hosting
Tools Used: Firebase (Hosting and Firestore)
What it does:
Firebase will handle both the hosting of the application (via Firebase Hosting) and the Firestore database (to store user data like questionnaire responses, diet plans, etc.). It will also handle the API requests between the frontend and backend.
Why we use it:
Firebase offers a serverless solution, meaning you don’t need to manage servers manually. This keeps the setup simple, scalable, and cost-effective, which is perfect for our MVP.

7. Payment Integration
Tool Used: Stripe (Free Tier)
What it does:
Stripe will be used for payment processing, allowing users to subscribe to the app, make payments for premium features, or make donations. It’s easy to integrate with ReactJS and other web technologies.
Why we use it:
Stripe is a trusted and secure payment processor with robust documentation. It supports multiple currencies and is widely used in startups due to its simplicity and low fees.

They complete the questionnaire, which is stored in Firebase Firestore.
Based on the data, GPT-3 generates a personalized diet plan.
The user can upload food images, which are analyzed by Clarifai to add nutritional data.
The completed plan is made available for download in PDF or Excel formats using jsPDF and SheetJS.
Users can pay for premium features through Stripe.

Conclusion
In summary, we’re using a combination of light, free, and open-source tools to build the MVP for Dietify. These tools are reliable, scalable, and cost-effective, which allows us to provide a high-quality product at an affordable price. Each tool has been carefully selected to serve a specific purpose, ensuring that the project is easy to manage, secure, and efficient.
These technologies will enable us to build a powerful, AI-driven diet plan generator, with the ability to analyze food images, deliver results in downloadable formats, and even integrate payments for future premium features.
