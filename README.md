# Dietify-Doc.


## Objective

This document provides an overview of the tools, technologies, and libraries used to build the Dietify MVP. It explains the purpose and benefits of each component, offering a clear understanding of how they contribute to the application.

## MVP Overview

The Dietify MVP (Minimum Viable Product) enables users to:

- Sign up and log in (Authentication)
- Complete a health and eating habits questionnaire
- Receive a personalized diet plan based on their input
- Upload food images for nutritional analysis
- Download the diet plan in PDF or Excel formats

## Key Components

1. **User Authentication**
   - **Tool Used**: Firebase Authentication (Free Tier)
   - **What it does**: Manages user sign-ups, logins, and account management.
   - **Why we use it**: Easy to integrate, secure, and scalable.

2. **Questionnaire for Customization**
   - **Tool Used**: ReactJS (Frontend) + Firebase Firestore (Backend)
   - **What it does**: Collects user data through interactive forms and stores it in Firebase Firestore.
   - **Why we use it**: ReactJS offers a smooth user interface, and Firestore is fast, scalable, and handles real-time data efficiently.

3. **AI for Personalized Diet Plan Generation**
   - **Tool Used**: OpenAI GPT-3 (Free Tier or Custom Models)
   - **What it does**: Processes user input to generate a personalized diet plan.
   - **Why we use it**: GPT-3 is a flexible and powerful language model that creates tailored diet plans efficiently.

4. **Food Image Analysis**
   - **Tool Used**: Clarifai (Free Tier)
   - **What it does**: Analyzes uploaded food images to identify food items and provide nutritional data.
   - **Why we use it**: Clarifai's AI-powered tool offers reliable image recognition and nutritional analysis.

5. **Results Delivery (PDF/Excel Downloads)**
   - **Tools Used**: jsPDF (For PDF) + SheetJS (For Excel)
   - **What they do**: Generate downloadable PDF and Excel files with the user’s diet plan.
   - **Why we use them**: Both libraries are lightweight, open-source, and easy to integrate for document generation.

6. **Backend and Database Hosting**
   - **Tools Used**: Firebase Hosting + Firestore
   - **What it does**: Hosts the app and manages the Firestore database for storing user data.
   - **Why we use it**: Firebase offers a serverless solution, keeping the setup simple and cost-effective.

7. **Payment Integration**
   - **Tool Used**: Stripe (Free Tier)
   - **What it does**: Handles payment processing for premium features and subscriptions.
   - **Why we use it**: Stripe is secure, easy to integrate, and widely used for handling payments in startups.
